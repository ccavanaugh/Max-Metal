## Print recommendations
All parts are deigned to be printed with a layer height of 0.1 mm.  Use of a slicer that can combine infill layers is highly recommended to reduce print time.  
I am printing 0.1 mm layers with 3 stacked layer (0.3 mm) for all sparse infill.  

Slic3r and Kisslicer Pro are known to be capable.  
 
## Small parts
The *Idler Hub* is an optional design vs. using the Open Builds idler assembly.  2 are required for each tower along 
with 2X 11 mm OD X 4 mm Wide x 5 mm ID bearings.
The *Trick Truck Belt Spacer* is required to keep the belt parallel to the axis of travel if you are using Trick Trucks.

These parts must be printed at 100% infill at 0.1 mm layer height. A larger layer height may create dimensional issues
  depending on the slicer used.  
  
  They must be flat!  PLA should provide sufficient strength.

## EZStruder Mount
This part is chunky.  We don't want it flexing under heavy retractions and it will see some radiated heat because of
proximity to the stepper motor.  Print with 20% infill.  

ABS or a nylon material is best, but PLA should be fine if your
stepper is not running hot or is actively cooled.

## Power Supply Bracket
Print with 25% or denser infill.  It should not see much heat so PLA is fine.

## Spool Cone
Print with support enabled

## End Stop Cap
Small caps for the end stop screws you can put a wrench on or turn by hand.  Stick the screw through with the head going into the counter-bore.
Fill flush with epoxy.

## Remaining parts
The other parts may be printed with infill and layer heights to suit.
