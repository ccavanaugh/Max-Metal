## Small parts
The Idler Hub is an optional design vs. using the Open Builds idler assembly.  2 are required for each tower along with 2 11mm OD X 4mm Wide x 5mm ID bearings.
The Trick Truck Belt Spacer is required to keep the belt parallel to the axis of travel if you are using the Trick Trick.

These should be printed at 100% infill at .1mm layer height.  They must be flat!  PLA should provide sufficient strength.

## Remaining parts
The other parts may be printed with infill and layer heights to suit.  
All parts are designed to be printed without support on a will tuned printer
